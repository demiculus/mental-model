# About

Imagine your mind as an operating system. Ever since you've come to this world you've been programmed by your parents, friends, society.. You are currently being programmed by me. With such extensive inputs your codes develop many bugs thus you should be doing bug fixing. Another thing you can do is install stronger apps. These apps are called Mental-Models and this list is to show you how to learn(install) each mental model. I haven't made a bug fixing tool yet, but if you want to get a head start find me on all social networks as [@demiculus](https://twitter.com/demiculus) or reach out from [my website](demiculus.com)

### Prerequisite

Each mental model is built on top of other Mental-Models. 
A good example for this is in order to learn Basic Arithmethics you first need to learn Numbers.

### Learning(Installing)

You are not only changing your mind but also changing your brain physically. It will take a couple days for you to learn the basics and a couple weeks for the Mental-Model to be stable. Just go through the practices daily for a month and you will have successfully changed your brain.

### Ways To Practice

Create a document for each mental model you're practicing on your notepad or a piece of paper.
Practice the mental-model for 30 days.
I use [evernote](https://www.evernote.com/referral/Registration.action?sig=3bccbbd47549eb2344f32d1197bde8a9494256e8d55cd55f23e4bd8ce31add07&uid=89210166) and keep it like [this](http://prntscr.com/o88fhu), here is an [example page](http://prntscr.com/o88fyl).

### Contribution

Feel free to add your own mental models [here](https://github.com/demiculus/mentalmodel/tree/master/_mental_models). Let [me know](mailto: demirbyilmaz@gmail.com) if you don't know how to use github.

### Having a Hard Time

If you're having a hard time with a specific mental model you probably are missing a prerequisite. Either try to identify what it is, practice with a friend or work on another mental model.

<!-- ### Practice Days

Spacing Effect - https://collegeinfogeek.com/spaced-repetition-memory-technique/
This doesn't seem to work very well to attain new habits (change your brain) but works to keep information. I suggest practicing daily for the first 20 days. -->

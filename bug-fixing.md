### Description

Imagine our mind as a complicated computer program. Just like computer programs not always working the way we want, same goes for our mind. It won't always function the way that we desire.

[A software bug](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_bug) is an error, flaw, failure or fault in a computer program or system that causes it to produce an incorrect or unexpected result, or to behave in unintended ways.

Same goes for the mind bug. Mind behaving in unintended ways can be categorized as mind bugs. 

There are 3 main steps to take in order to find and fix bugs. 

1. Identify bugs
2. Find the core bug
3. Fix the core bug


### Identify Bugs

This part is pretty easy. Just write a list of all the recent unexpected results.

Some examples would be; getting angry at that event, feeling shy towards someone, not being able to afford the newest iPhone, not having a fit body, drinking alcohol 5 nights a week. 

Select one of them to focus on.

### Finding the core bug

We will use the [5-whys tool](https://mmpractices.com/mental_models/5-whys/) for this. Go ahead and read it. 

An example usage would be; 

> Q: Why was I not able to afford the newest iPhone?
> 
> A: Because I spent all my extra money on dining out with friends.
>
> Q: Why did I spend so much to hangout with friends?
>
> A: Because I want to be accepted by them and I believe money is the only thing I can contribute.
>
> Q1: Why do I want to be accepted by them?
>
> A1: Otherwise I will be lonely. I don't want to be lonely.
>
> Q1: Why do I not want to be lonely?
>
> A1: Because I will think about all my lifes problems and I'm trying to avoid it.
>
> Q1: Why am I avoiding my lifes problems?
>
> A1: Because it feels like I won't be able to handle them.
>
> Q2: Why do I think money is the only thing I can contribute?
>
> A2: Because I don't think my personality is great.
>
> Q2: Why don't I think my personality is great?
>
> A2: Because I was raised without self-confidence.

Here we found 2 core bugs. 

1. Avoiding lifes problems
2. Lack of self-confidence

Using this tool requires practice (experience) & self honesty. It is not easy to get to the core bugs the first times you try but over time you will start using the tool better. 

Note that most of the core problems come from our childhood programming (traumas). Thus it always helps to consult a psychologist or educate yourself about childhood traumas. 

### Fixing the core bug

Ideally we want to fix the core bug but every bug requires a different type of tool to fix and we usually don't have the required tool to fix the bug so there are 4 things we can do.

1. Create the tool - Humans are very good at creating tools, not just physical but mental ones as well
2. Research the tool online - It is even easier to copy the tool from someone else
3. Ask for tools - Telling friends or writing on online forums about our problem is helpful where people are likely to share the tools they know.
4. Go to a psyhcologist to obtain the tool.

Multiple tools might be needed to fix the core bug as well as multiple tools can fix the core bug in different ways on their own. 


### FAQ:

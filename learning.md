# Learning

Learning a mental model means you are not changing your mind but also changing your brain physically. 

If you try to learn everything at once your mind won't have enough time for neural processing to take place.

You should take your time and do daily practices and take enough rests between practices for your neural processing to settledown.

Don't forget the importance of sleep and washing away the toxins during our days activities. You should avoid doing anything important with little sleep because it is like trying to think with poison on the brain.

# Practicing

Each mental model is a skill. Like any other skill with practice you will be better and without practice it will decline slowly. 


> The way to get that competency is to adopt the necessary elements and practice using it over a considerable period of time on a considerable area of complexity.

[Charlie Munger](https://youtu.be/4ibabROYccs?t=1804)


Best way to approach practicing mental models is the same way on we approach going to the gym. You should be hitting the mental gym at least 3-4 times per week. You should have a workout schedule for each type of exercise you do. And you should rest between gym sessions.

The best method I've found is keeping to a strict daily 15-30 minute practice. 

I use [evernote](https://www.evernote.com/referral/Registration.action?sig=3bccbbd47549eb2344f32d1197bde8a9494256e8d55cd55f23e4bd8ce31add07&uid=89210166) as my gym. You can use a notebook, a note application or even a blog. I have a diffeerent sheet in evernote for each mental model.

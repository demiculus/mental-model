#### Description

Goal: Is a certain point on a scale which we want to achieve in a certain amount of time. Ex: 100 pushups in 1 month

Aim: A direction we want to go. Ex: Strong arms

When we set a goal we make many assumptions. We don't know whether our body, life, mind, time, relationships are suited in a way to achieve the goal in the given time. But we have created expectations of ourselves. This will create anxiety in many scenarios such as

- If we're behind schedule
- If the goal is too big

and such anxieties will increase our chances of changing the goal thus goal never being achieved. This is why smaller goals have a higher percentage completion rates than bigger goals.

Goals are dangerous, should be avoided and replaced by aims. Aims are directions we want to go in. They do not create anxiety or stress. It is just there pointing us.

To go towards our aims we should have processes.

By having aim + process instead of goals we decrease the negative possiblities while keeping the positives which is

- Becoming better
- Good feeling when we reach a milestone

Note1: A process is a `Small Consistant Set of Goals`. If you make the process hard it will be the same as setting a normal goal. 

Note2: If you stop doing your process this means that your process is too hard. Dile it down. If your process includes 30 minutes of workout everyday and you stop doing it, decrease it to 10, if it is still too much decrease it to 5 or even 1 minutes. The compounding effect of doing 5 minute workout per day will be better than a 30 minute push and then stopping doing it. 

#### Awareness of Goals

1. Think of a goal you have/had
2. Think about your achievement status

#### Replacing Goals

##### Practice

1. Write a goal you want to achieve
2. Replace it with a more generic aim
3. Create a process which improves you towards your aim

##### Examples

1. I want to do 50 pushups
2. I want to have stronger arms
3. Do 10 minute pushup exercises 6 days a week, 10 minute research on pushup exercises 7th day

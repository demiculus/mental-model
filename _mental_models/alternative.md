#### Description

When facing a problem we often think limitedly. We think about the first few things we can do select one of them and move forward. This is good for a lot of decisions but a certain number of decisions benefit greatly by exploring a bit more. 

By doing this practice your mind will be able to come up with more possibilities.


#### Practice

1. Think of a problem
2. Think of all the solutions you can think of. Make sure to include obviously wrong solutions, which are still solutions.
3. Once you've written down all solutions you can think of, write down 3 absurd solutions

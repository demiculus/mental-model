#### Description

Games can be categorized in 2 ways

1. Theme park
2. Sandbox

Theme park games hold the player by the hand and takes them through the theme park. [Candy crush](https://i.redd.it/u25jttpjhgi01.jpg) is a good example. The levels are predefined and the player doesn't have to decide what to do next.

In sandbox games the player is thrown into a world and then they have to decide what they want to do. Minecraft is a good example. The player can choose to build a village, mine, fight zombies, create structures etc..

Our society is a theme park society. 

Parents tell us what to do, what to eat, what to wear.

Schools tell us what to study, how to study.

Our whole life is structured in front of us and we won't fail as long as we follow the guide and never make a decision. In such a society where all the quests are externally assigned it is hard to cultivate internal quest assignment skill.

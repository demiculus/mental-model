#### Description

Everything has a default state and will require energy to move it to its non-default state. An amount of energy needs to be used in order to move it to a new default state. And an amount of energy needs to be used in order to keep it at its desired state. Sometimes this energy can be outsourced.
 
Ex: A relationship's default state is non-existant. Left alone, the relationship will migrate to its default state.
Ex: A companies default state is non-existant. Left alone, the company will migrate to its default state.

Ex: Weddings transfer part of the energy requirement from the couple to the societ & laws. Thus marrying decreases the minimum required energy to keep the relationship going. I.e. it increases the energy needed in order to stop being married.

#### Practice

1. Think of something you will do today/this week.
2. What is the goal of that something? 
3. What would be the default state of this situation if no energy was given.
4. What type of situation decrease/increase the amount of energy needed for the system to run.

#### Example-1

1. I will go to gym and workout.
2. Goals: 
	- Cure my wrists
	- Have better looking shoulders
	- Be able to do cool moves
3. Default state: I don't push myself and not have the above 3 goals
4. Things that decrease/increase the amount of energy needed to achieve the goals
	- Dec: Paying for a trainer decreases the amount of energy I spend to achieve my goals
	- Dec: Having a training schedule decreases the amount of energy I spend each session
	- Dec: Having close friends at the gym decreases the amount of energy I spend to go there
	- Inc: Further away the gym from my house, the more energy it requires to go there

Dec (Actions which decrease the used energy) 

Inc (Actions which increase the used energy)

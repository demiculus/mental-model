#### Description

3 types of decision making
- Logical
- Emotional
- Intuitive

Intuition is what you feel about a certain action/event/place/person after all of your emotion & logic are separated.
It gives a clear signal if that thing will be good/bad for you.

#### Practice

Length: 2 minutes (practice takes around 2 minutes)

1. Write an action/event/location you will interact with today.
2. Close your eyes and imagine yourself doing that thing. 
3. Write down how you feel when doing that thing. Start with "I feel"
4. Close your eyes and imagine yourself not doing that thing.
5. Write down how you feel when you don't do that thing. Start with "I feel"

#### Example-1

Going to Toastmasters: Imagining going there creates excitement
Not Going There: Imagining not going there creates anxiousness like I am missing something

#### Example-2

Go to the BBQ party: I feel like it will be interesting.
Not going to BBQ party: I feel like I will miss something.

#### Extra

Knowing [cognitive biases](https://www.visualcapitalist.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/cognitive-bias-infographic.html) increases the strength of intuitive thinking.

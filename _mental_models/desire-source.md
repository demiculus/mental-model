#### Description

Desires can be grouped in many ways. An easy way of grouping would be external vs internal.

An external desire is something obtained from external sources and will cease to exist when the source goes away. Internal desires usually take decades to form thus are not expected to go away easily. Each desire has a trigger. When run into it the desire will be activated.

Knowing where the desire comes from helps us take control of the decision. 

Pursuing internal desires is better than external desires due to compounding effect. The external desire might fade away leaving us hating the thing that we're doing wether that thing is a job we accepted a hobby we started or a company we're building. On some occasions it might be beneficial for us to pursue the external desire. By understanding it we can make sure to put ourselves in situations where we are exposed to that thing more.

#### Practice

3. When I stop talking with the auntie my desire to solve that problem goes away. 

#### Example 2

1. Creating dance videos
2. Watching my friends doing dance videos on instagram & tiktok
3. When I unfollow those friends my desire goes away.

#### Description

Most of the time, when we successfully overcome a problem, we often lack a complete understanding of why it was resolved. As a result, when a similar problem arises in the future, it becomes difficult to solve it easily.

However, in cases where we fully comprehend the underlying cause of the problem, encountering it again becomes effortless to resolve. Therefore, it is advisable to prioritize gaining understanding rather than merely finding quick solutions to problems.
When there is a problem we can take 2 approaches: 

 1. Focus on fixing it by trying out stuff, eventually one of the solutions work so we can move on.

 2. Focus on understanding how it works.



#### Examples:

##### Software Development

Here is an example of how my co-worker implemented this model to their work.

> I was trying to solve the a bug where users ended up not taking action X. I got curious and wrote queries on how many users were running into this bug. I saw that 5% of people did not take action X because of this bug. But I also discovered that another 10% also did not take action X. I dived into why that was the case ; and turns out it was due to a logic (programming concept) we impleneted. I looked at the submission that created the logic that was based on an assumption. Then I asked 5 players their thoughts about the result of this logic and turns out none of them want this feature. Then I ran this poll in the community to verify it. I solved the initial bug, I created design tasks for the second bug and I saved the queries so it'll be easy for us to run them in the future.

Here the developer has acquired a good understanding of user behavior, instead of solving an unwanted bug they figured out if it was necessary for the users, then created systems making it easier for future developers.

Another time they said something like this:

>I was trying to solve the rendering problem, but I didn't know how rendering worked. So, I spent 20 minutes learning about it. Then, I realized I didn't understand how our library rendered, so I dedicated another 20 minutes to understanding it. After that, I became curious about how we were using the library, so I spent 20 minutes gaining clarity on that aspect. It dawned on me that we could solve our rendering problem by changing just one line of code. Additionally, I noticed that our rendering process was not optimized, so I submitted a task to refactor our rendering engine, which would clean up our codebase. I also created two other tasks, which are of lower impact, but will further optimize rendering when necessary.

Here the developer not only solved the problem but became an expert in it. So any future rendering problems he will be able to handle it easily. 

The developer who understands why it works will 
- spend less time solving the same bugs
- create better solutions
unlike the developers in the memes :) 

##### UX Design

Same as developer, 2 approaches.

1. Creates 5 types of button designs, PM selects one of the design and asks specific parts to change. Designer changes it submits it, after 3 iterations it gets approved. Short term problem solved. But next time something similar happens designer will still waste time with the wrong stuff and need iterations.

2. Creates 5 types of button designs. Says `Design A` is the best. PM selects `Design B` and asks for iterations. The designer gets curious why that was selected. Reads case studies. Ask the PM for the reason. Talks to users. And understands fully what needs to be done and why. Then does 1 iteration and it gets approved.

Here the designer spent time understanding what needs to be done and why. In the future the designer won't be needing feedback from the PM.

##### Management

Lets say a team member messed up somewhere.

1. The manager gives feedbacks, asks it to be fixed and moved on.
2. The manager asks questions to gain deeper understanding of the employee's situation.

> I think youâ€™re smart and conscientious, however I noticed a drop in your performance and I want to understand why that is. 
> 
> 1. How are you feeling about your current workload and responsibilities?
> 2. Are there any specific challenges or obstacles you're facing that are affecting your performance?
> 3. Is there anything about the work environment that you find demotivating or hindering your productivity?
> 4. Are you clear on the goals and expectations set for your role? If not, what areas need clarification? 
> 5. Have there been any changes in your personal or professional life that could be impacting your work?
> 6. Have you been receiving feedback or guidance on your performance? If so, what has been helpful, and what would you like to see more of?
> 7. What resources or tools do you believe would assist you in improving your performance?

Active listening and providing a safe space for open and honest communication are essential during these discussions. It's crucial to avoid placing blame and instead focus on finding solutions and offering support to help the employee succeed. By asking more question the manager can delve deeper into understanding how the employee works. What temperature are they working at? What devices do they use? What is their work environment like? What are their working hours? Are they getting enough sleep? Are they rushing things? Are they organized? Do they take notes? These inquiries help the manager gain a better understanding of the employee's work habits and preferences, ultimately leading to a clearer understanding of the individual's work style." 

##### Relationship

Your significant other (SO) has been frowning for the past week.

1. You decide to take them out to dinner, and they become happy. Problem solved, so you go home and sleep.
2. You ask your SO why they are frowning? What feelings are they experiencing? Would they like to talk about it or have some space? Is it related to you or something they experienced at work, with another friend, etc.? How can you support them? 
By asking these questions, you can understand the reason behind the frowning of your SO, their needs, and how you can help them. 

Your goal is to understand how things work. 

#### Practice

1. Select one thing you're working on
2. Book 60 minutes in your calendar
3. Spend 15 minutes diving to understand a core thing
4. Spend another 15 minutes for the next related thing
5. Repeat 15 minutes 2 more times
6. Now you can solve the problem

Whatever you dive in 4x15 minutes you should become a semi-expert in 4 components of that thing.

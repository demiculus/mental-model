#### Description

Asymmetrical Risks: Upside is very small and down side is huge
Assymetrical Values: Down side is very small but the upside is huge

Being aware if an action is asymmetric helps us avoid crippling actions while makes it easier to seek oppourtunistic actions.

Ex: 
Texting while driving, 
Benefit: is a funny cat picture
Risk:is cripple for life.

Ex: 
Unprotected sex: 
Benefit: is fun for an hour
Risk: HIV for the rest of your life

Ex:
DM'ing people
Benefit: you meet a life long lasting friend
Risk: 1minute of your life lost

#### Practice

Method1: Think of an action you will do today, what is the positive & the negative asymmetric value?

Method2: Think of a concept, what actions would provide with positive asymmetric value and what actions would provide negative.

#### Example-1

I will go to Ubud from Canggu. What are some actions that would provide me with asymmetry? 

- P: Posting on social media to share a ride with random people (might turn out to be a long time friend, business partner etc) 
- P: If I look around while going, I can stop to check out interesting places on the road
- N: Drive fast and crash car
- N: If I'm not careful with my belongings they might be stolen

#### Example-2

I am working on Colonist.io (my game). What are some actions that might provide me with asymmetry? 


- P: Streaming while working may provide followers, help and much more
- P: Working at public places may provide extra contact with others
- N: Streaming wrong things may get us in to trouble legally or decrease trust of our players

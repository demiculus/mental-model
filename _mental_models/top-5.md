#### Description

The top 5 are in order below.

1. Relationships
2. Sleep
3. Workout
4. Work
5. Nutritions

Breaking any one of these will break everything that comes after it as well as everything else in life. 

If a person does not have good relationships it doesn't matter how much they workout, how healthy they eat, how much they try to focus on their work or how comfortable sleeping arrangement they make, they will have issues with all of them. You must have heard the saying `leave your relationship issues outside`. Yet it is one of the hardest things. We as humans are wired for social connectivity more than anything else. 

Once a person has no relationship problems they can go on with the next MOST IMPORTANT item on the list. Which is sleep. Having a bad sleep schedule will make everything that comes after it worse. So if a person isn't getting enough sleep it doesn't matter how healthy they eat. 

When a person has good relationships and good sleep the next thing that will improve their life the most is a routine workout. It doesn't matter if they work at the best job in the world. If they aren't getting enough exercises they will feel tired, will have neck pain, back pain and all sorts of other biological conditions which make their work life much harder.

Once a person has the top 3 stacked in a good way the next item is work. The work should be satisfactory & should suit the person. If they are being stressed because of work nutritions don't matter. They can eat all the carbs or all the veggies they want. It won't improve their life much with respect to the decrease their unsatisfying job gives them.

Finally the last item on the list is nutritions. When a person has all of these 5 items, they have achieved happiness 90%

#### Backwards 

Now lets think of all of these backwards. 

If a person has #2-5 but has relationship issues (this can be with parents, siblings, lover, friends, co-workers..) the nutritions might not be effective, their mind might wander off during work, they'll be less motivated for workout and they might have hard time sleeping at nights. 

If a person has all of them except for Sleep. The nutritions might not be as effective, they might not be able to focus on work, they might not be motivated to do workout.

and same with workout, work & nutritions.

#### Exercise

##### Method
1. On a scale of 1-10 give points to how good these categories are in your life wheres 1 = Bad & 5 = Okay, 10 = Great
2. Take first one which is lower than 6 
3. This is your priority at this part of your life, use the other mental models to make this one better

##### Example
1. 
  - Relationships: 8
  - Sleep: 6
  - Workout: 2
  - Work: 2
  - Nutritions: 1
2. Workout is the top one lower than 6
3. Use the [5 whys mental model](https://mmpractices.com/mental_models/5-whys/) to understand why I am not working out & use [prerequisite mental model](https://mmpractices.com/mental_models/prerequisites/) to figure out how I can work out more.

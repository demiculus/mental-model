#### Description

Sometimes we surround ourselves with the people that we like, but we dont get a benefit by having this relationship. Even we might be having hard times because of this, this is so hard for almost every people to cut off the person that we shared something, even the bad memories.
So it is the best that thinking wisely before letting in someone new in our life. When we make wrong choices, it can drain our energy for the negative emotions that we didnt expect.
Once we dont get to control how to spend our energy inside us, we can easily lose the power of controlling how we feel. And the good feelings like love, purity, peace, trust etc. is the key of a happy life. Happy life means making the right decisions in other perspectives in life.
This practice increases our skills in surrounding ourselves with the people that only gives benefit, not harm. 

#### Practice: 

1. write down the person you choose to observe
2. write down their personalities, how are their attitude, how are their relationships with other people. Are they happy, succesfull, trustworthy, pure, peaceful etc?
3. then make a list  with pros and cons for 3 days, what it would be like if you have this person in your life
4. if you already have negative emotions like fear, second thoughts you can make your desicion already.
5. if you cannot find anything negative and imagining having this person doesnt give you hard feelings, you can make your desicion too.

#### Example 1 : 
Should I date the boy whom asked me out?
He is goodlooking and makes me excited. He makes me feel beautiful, wanted. 
When he steps back I go crazy with lack of these emotions and being a person that doesnt love herself, stops doing the responsibilities because of a broken heart.
So beside of having some little good feelings, there is an actual harm that drains my energy with this person.
So the right desicion is ending up the relationship/ not starting.

#### Example 2: 
There is a girl in my class and we started to create a bond.
I need to observe her words, actions like how she handles school responsibilities, how she acts to the people, how she achieves her goals even if has she goals? 
Is she punctual, does she care about my emotions, does she have a good personality?
If I can observe the lack of ethics in her behaviour or catching anything that can give me harm, i should try to stay away and maybe observe a little more instead of creating stronger bond.
If I cannot find anything bad in 3 days, I can give a shot for this person.


#### Bugs: Sometimes 3 days arenâ€™t enough to observe people. If we are in a situation with deeper connections, we can stretch the time to longer. Like we have someone for 3 years, and not sure if it good. We can give our some time like a month, and genuinely observe for a month and make the right decision.

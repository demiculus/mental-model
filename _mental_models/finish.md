#### Description

This is an evolved form of Next Steps https://mmpractices.com/mental_models/next-step/ 

When we contact our superior with stuff we should have the full plan layed out. He shouldn't be asking questions like, so? whats next?. All the whats should be clear. He should either be asking to try and understand. Like `why..` `how..`. Or telling you to move forward with it. 


#### Practice

1. Write down one thing you contacted your boss with.
2. Write down the total execution strategy and how you would convey it to your boss.

#### Example-1

Bad Employee: It is hard for me to test these abtests because I have to create a new account.
Manager: So? What do you want me to do? Why not solve your problem?

Bad Employee2: It is hard for me to test these abtests. Can you create a task for devs so they can implement a feature where I can change my abtests?
Manager: Why don't you created it?

Good Employee: It is hard for me to test these abtests. So I created this task for devs to implement a feature where I can easily change my abtests.
Manager: üëç


#### Example-2


Bad Employee: You shouldn't post such things to reddit.
Manager: What things? There are 4 posts there.

Good Employee: You shouldn't post these things to reddit: `url of post`. The other 3 are fine. You should
  1. Delete this post: `url of post`
  2. In the future don't write .... type of comments.
Manager: Ok, I deleted the bad post.

summary: We occasionally get stuck in a loop where we non-stop simulate an interaction. Planning something once is okay but non-stop is unhealthy.
prerequisites: Simulation

#### Description

This mental model is for people who often find themselves simulating interactions such as what they're going to do when they go on the date, how the talk will go with their boss/principle, or what they could have said instead of the blabber they did.

When these plans are unconcious and become an obsessive repeated behavior they are unhealthy and waste of time. So it is best to be aware when we are running such simulations more than we should be and stopping them. 

#### Practice

Imagine yourself in a future conversation and run a mental simulation of that conversation. Then stop that imagination and get back to the current world.

This will increase the likelihood of you being aware of such thought processes and changing them.

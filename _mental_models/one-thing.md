#### Description

Not all items on your to-do list are created equal, so in order to make the biggest leaps in the shortest amount of time, youâ€™d be best off ruthlessly prioritizing them. Identifying the single most important task and just doing that will yield greater results rather than trying to finish random tasks in the TODO list.

#### Practice

1. Write an action/event/location you will interact with.
2. Write down the ONE thing you can do, such that by doing it everything else will become easier or unnecessary?

Repeat this 4 times.

#### Example-1

One thing I can do, such that by doing it everything else will become easier or unnecessary?
- Work: Figure out if we should use freestar.io as monetization
- Event: Meet as many people as possible
- Today: Wake up early and meditate
- Breakdance: Flexibility (I will get injured less, it will be easier for me to do all the moves)

#### Example-2

One thing I can do, such that by doing it everything else will become easier or unnecessary?
- Sport: Wrist strength (injured my wrists)
- Meeting: Understand clearly what the other side needs
- General: Buy a new MacBook cable (tired of nudging it every minute)
- Instagram: Mute everyone uninteresting

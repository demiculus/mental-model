#### Description

Our mind isn't linear, it has many moving parts and different incentives. Which is why it is usually not clear what we want. 

For example, when it comes to work, a part of us might be wanting online work, while another part wanting close social interations. while another part wanting extended focus time, while another part wanting to manage people. 

This is usually the case when it comes to any complicated system such as relationships, family, school, hobbies etc.

This practice increases our skills in clarifying our need. 

#### Practice

Get a practice journal, it can be an online notepad or something physical. Everyday for the next 30 days write down

1. Date
2. 'What do I want?'
3. Write the first thing that comes to your mind.
4. 'Why'
5. Write as many reasons as you want.
6. If you decide to change your answer, you continue from step2.

##### Example

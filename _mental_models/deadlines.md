#### Description

Making though decisions are hard. People are inclined to avoid or procastinate rather than making the decision. Putting an artifical deadline forces you to make the decision. 

#### Practice

Whenever there is a TODO, put an artificial deadline for it's decision. If you can't make the decision now, decision should be I'll figure this till N

#### Example-1

1. 6pm on Monday I'll make the decision. At five minutes to 6 usually you don't know the answer but in those 5 minutes something clicks, and by 6pm the answer is always there.
